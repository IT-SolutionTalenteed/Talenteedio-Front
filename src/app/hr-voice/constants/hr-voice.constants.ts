The idea is to use a web service that allows natural referencing via metadata in search engines and social networks, and also to use artificial intelligence to perform a number of sorting tasks on applications.

During the second quarter of 2023, we intend to develop our activity in West Africa, through the launch of a structure in Senegal and Ivory Coast.
